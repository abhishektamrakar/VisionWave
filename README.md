# VisionWave: Your Virtual Lens

VisionWave is an innovative web application that replicates the functionality of a webcam, allowing you to capture, view, and process live camera feeds in a virtual environment. It's your virtual lens to explore the world of real-time camera manipulation and creativity.

## Project Preview

VisionWave redefines the possibilities of webcam usage in a web application. Here's a glimpse of what this project has to offer:

- **Live Camera Feed:** VisionWave lets you access your device's webcam through the MediaStream API, providing a real-time camera feed within the web application.

- **WebCam User Interface:** We have designed an intuitive and user-friendly webcam interface, making it easy for you to interact with and control the camera feed.

- **Canvas API Integration:** To enhance your experience, VisionWave employs the Canvas API to render the camera feed and offers a variety of real-time image processing capabilities. You can apply filters, effects, and overlays to the live feed.

- **MediaRecorder API:** Capture and record moments by utilizing the MediaRecorder API to save videos or image sequences. It gives you the power to create your own multimedia content directly from the live webcam feed.
